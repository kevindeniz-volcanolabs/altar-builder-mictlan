# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Altar Builder Mictlán is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for building virtual Day of the Dead altars. The application provides an interactive grid-based workspace where users can drag and drop traditional ofrenda elements to create culturally authentic altars. The system implements three progressive complexity levels: Ofrenda (basic functionality), Catrina (interactive features), and Mictlán (full Kiro framework implementation with collaborative editing).

## Glossary

- **Altar_Builder_System**: The complete PWA application for creating virtual Day of the Dead altars
- **Grid_Workspace**: The interactive 9x12 cell grid where users place altar elements
- **Ofrenda_Element**: Traditional Day of the Dead items (velas, flores, fotos, pan de muerto, etc.)
- **Element_Panel**: The sidebar containing available elements for placement
- **Zustand_Store**: The state management system for application data
- **Service_Worker**: The background script enabling offline functionality
- **Kiro_MCP**: The Model Context Protocol integration for advanced state management
- **Mariposa**: Animated monarch butterfly with steering behaviors
- **WebRTC_Connection**: Peer-to-peer connection for collaborative editing
- **Altar_Score**: Numerical rating based on composition and traditional layout rules
